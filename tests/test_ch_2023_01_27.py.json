Fresh snow and freshly generated snowdrift accumulations were frequently deposited on top of a relatively unfavourable old snowpack surface. In more deeply embedded layers inside the snow cover, crusts have been generated as a consequence of repeated bouts of rainfall and subsequently descending temperatures. These layers are predominantly compact and stable. However, above approximately 2600 m there is an expansively metamorphosed (faceted) layer wedged between generally thin crusts which constitutes a potentially weak layer.</p>"
