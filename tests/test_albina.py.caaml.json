        "comment": "Over a wide area 15 to 30 cm of snow, and even more in some localities, will fall from early morning above approximately 1500 m. The new snow and wind slabs remain very prone to triggering in all aspects above the tree line. This applies in particular on very steep slopes, and adjacent to ridgelines. Dry avalanches can be released by small loads or triggered naturally. <br/> In addition a latent danger of gliding avalanches and moist snow slides exists. Until the temperature falls more medium-sized moist slab avalanches are possible. They can also penetrate deep layers and reach quite a large size, caution is to be exercised, including on cut and grassy slopes. <br/> Extensive experience in the assessment of avalanche danger is required. Areas with glide cracks are to be avoided as far as possible."
