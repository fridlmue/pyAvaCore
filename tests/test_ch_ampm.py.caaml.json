Defensive route selection is appropriate. \n The small wind slabs of the last few days are in individual cases still prone to triggering at elevated altitudes.

The wind slabs are to be evaluated with care and prudence in very steep terrain.\nAs a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation more frequent medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large wet and gliding avalanches are to be expected. The avalanche prone locations for gliding avalanches are to be found in particular on steep sunny slopes below approximately 2400 m. Especially on very steep south facing slopes more wet loose snow avalanches are to be expected below approximately 3000 m.

Individual avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular in little used terrain and in areas where the snow cover is rather shallow. Defensive route selection is appropriate. \n The small wind slabs of the last few days are in individual cases still prone to triggering at elevated altitudes. They are to be found in particular in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. The wind slabs are to be evaluated with care and prudence in very steep terrain.\nAs a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation more frequent medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large wet and gliding avalanches are to be expected. The avalanche prone locations for gliding avalanches are to be found in particular on steep sunny slopes below approximately 2400 m. Especially on very steep south facing slopes more wet loose snow avalanches are to be expected below approximately 3000 m. Additionally in some places wet avalanches can also release the entire snowpack and reach quite a large size. Backcountry tours should be concluded timely."
