The large quantity of fresh snow of the weekend as well as the wind slabs to be found in all aspects can be released easily, even by a single winter sport participant, above the tree line. Also slopes close to the tree line are unfavourable. Additionally avalanches can also be triggered in the old snowpack and reach large size, especially on steep shady slopes above approximately 2400 m, as well as on steep sunny slopes above approximately 2800 m. The off-piste conditions are critical. Extensive experience in the assessment of avalanche danger is required.",

The mostly small wind slabs can be released even by a single winter sport participant especially on very steep shady slopes at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions. The avalanche prone locations are rather rare. In the north the avalanche prone locations are a little more prevalent. Restraint should be exercised because avalanches can sweep people along and give rise to falls. <br/> The Avalanche Warning Service currently has only a small amount of information, so that the avalanche danger should be investigated especially thoroughly in the relevant locality.",
