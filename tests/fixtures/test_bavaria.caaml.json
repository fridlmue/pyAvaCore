Intensifying westerly winds will generate fresh, trigger-sensitive snowdrifts. Powdery, cold layers beneath fresh snowdrifts and thin layers of expansively metamorphosed crystals have created a trigger-sensitive snowpack. At higher altitudes the snowpack shows striking effects of wind, gullies and bowls are filled with drifts, combs and ridges are utterly windblown, bare of snow, icy surfaces are covered with drifts. At intermediate altitudes, melt-freeze crusts have formed down to about 1400 m, atop of which there is now powder snow. Amid wintery temperatures, the old snowpack has slowly consolidated, at ground level on south-facing slopes there is a moist layer. Near ground level above 1600 m, weak layers of faceted  crystals have persisted and are still prone to triggering in the eastern Bavarian Alps. Winds and fresh snow will play a big role in the coming days. The snowdrift problem still requires high attentiveness. Please note: ski areas are currently not being supervised or secured from avalanches."
