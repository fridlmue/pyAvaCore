A few minor pockets of windslab may accumulate on West to North facing slopes above 1000m, but this is expected to be minimal and easily avoidable. Snow cover is patchy, greatest amounts remain on steep north facing aspects above 1000m and on a range of aspects on the high plateau areas. The avalanche hazard will be Low",

        "WeatherInfluences": "Outbreaks of rain, freezing rain, sleet and snow are possible at any level overnight and during the day, as a new weather system results in complex temperature variables over the period.
