Especially windward slopes, couloirs and couloirs where large amounts of snow are blown by the wind are critical. Care should be taken in particular in places where the hardness of the snow changes, wind-blown slabs are noticeable or signs of wind-blown slabs (ripples or unevenly distributed snow cover) appear. In these places it is possible to release an avalanche even with a small additional load. Alternatively, smaller spontaneous avalanches, avalanches, or 'bursts' may occur.",
