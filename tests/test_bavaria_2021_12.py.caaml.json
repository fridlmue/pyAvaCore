Due to the burden of this snow on the old snowpack surface and settling impulses from solar radiation tomorrow (Friday), large-sized loosely-packed and slab avalanches could trigger naturally. These releases can be expected at all altitudes and in all aspects. Moreover, if they fracture down to deeper layers they could in isolated cases grow to large size. Exposed transportation routes and hiking trails could be placed at risk.\r\nApart from this, there is an old-snow problem. At high altitudes in all aspects there are ground-level weak layers of expansively metamorphosed (faceted) crystals which could trigger with large additional loading.",

Moderate strength NW winds have consolidated the snow slightly, deposited it atop an old snowpack surface of expansively metamorphosed (faceted) crystals or atop loose, cold intermediate layers of the fresh snow itself. Bonding of these layers is often inadequate. Older drifts are covered, lie bonded atop a loosely-packed cold layer and continue to be trigger-sensitive.
